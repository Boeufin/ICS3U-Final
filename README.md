# ICS3U-Final
This is where the final code will be stored for review.

# What The Project Does:
The Project keeps track of your tasks that you enter. You can edit and complete these tasks, and clear all.

# How The Project Works:
There are two input fields. One of them is for the task name and the other is for the details. Once you click create, a function will fire off. This function will add the inout data as well as the current date into one element in the array. The function will now call a for loop to create the last elements with the inputs of those specific data. 

Once the create button has been pressed, the tasks should appear in order as they were in the JS file. There are two buttons, one edit and one complete. The complete button will allow you to remove the task from the list once you have completed it. The edit button will allow you to edit the contents of your task and save them to the array. The sort buttons will allow you to re arrange the order of the items in the array and reprint them on the page in the requested order. 

You can keep adding as many tasks as you want; there is no limit. 

# How To Compile The Project: (gulp serve)
To compile the project, clone or dowload the project. Run npm install and gulp serve from the terminal, and the web server should start.

# Testing The Project:
To test The Project, simply type something into the input fields. Click create, and see if what you inputted is in the list. Click edit, and try to edit your details. Click complete, and the task should disappear. You should be able to sort your tasks from newest to oldest, and oldest to newest.
