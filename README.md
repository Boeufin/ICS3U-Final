# ICS3U-Final
This is where the final code will be stored for review.

# What The Project Does:
The Project keeps track of your tasks that you enter. You can edit and complete these tasks.

# How The Project Works:
The Project works by inputting values into two text fields. Once you click 'Create,' your task, along with it's description will be put in the tasks to do list. You can choose to edit or complete the task. When you click edit, a box appears with the inputted text. Do your edits, and after, reclick the edit button to save it. Once you click the Complete button, the task will disappear from the list.

# How To Compile The Project: (gulp serve)
To compile the project, clone or dowload the project. Run gulp serve from the terminal, and the web server should start.

# Testing The Project:
To test The Project, simply type something into the input fields. Click create, and see if what you inputted is in the list. Click edit, and try to edit your details. Click complete, and the task should disappear.
